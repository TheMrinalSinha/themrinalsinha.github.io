			<div id="sorry">
				I know saying sorry is just not enough for how much you are hurt, I'm sorry for being insensitive (I was unaware of what you are thinking). I don't know where to start because I have messed up so much, I swear aaj k baad ye love n shit ka naam v nahi lunga pakka. I have been so childish and immature and being so, I hurt you and caused this rift between us. I know how much you tolerate the worst in me and i really thank you for being such a friend. The damage is done and it's all because of me being a jerk. I'm sorry for whatever have happened as of now. Plz forgive me.
